<h2>Explaination of AJAX</h2>
<p>AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

  AJAX is not a programming language.
  
  AJAX just uses a combination of:
  
  A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
  JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)</p>
<h2>REST API</h2>
